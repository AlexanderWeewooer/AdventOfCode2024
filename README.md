# AdventOfCode2024
Submission for the Advent of Code 2024.
This year my goal while completing the challenge will be only using Python.
Which I deeply despise for unknown reasons.

(I will probably not finish it, the last year of HighSchool is difficult to say the least)

Day1: ok

Day2: currently losing my sanity (finally did it)

Day3: ok I was just tired, but then figured it out

Day4: finally had time and calmness to actually do it
